# wake-mii
A simple app to maintain alertness to improve productivity and awareness

Use wake-mii when studying to make sure you don't fall asleep in the middle your study session. wake-mii integrates with Interaxon Muse and determines when you're falling asleep.
If you are, it'll make your phone vibrateâ€”so stay awake!

Potential applications:
* Alert drivers when they're feeling drowsy
* Tell factory workers when they need to take a break
* Keep sleepy MIT students awake, without the need for artifical stimulants
