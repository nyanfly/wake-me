# wake-mii
A simple app to maintain alertness to improve productivity and awareness

Use wake-mii when studying to make sure you don't fall asleep in the middle of your study session. wake-mii integrates with Interaxon Muse and determines when you're falling asleep, based on EEG data reported by the Muse. It uses this data to determine your alpha to beta wave ratio, and thus whether you're awake or asleep.
If you do fall asleep, it'll make your phone vibrateâ€”so stay awake!

Potential applications:
* Alert drivers when they're feeling drowsy
* Tell factory workers when they need to take a break
* Keep sleepy MIT students awake, without the need for artifical stimulants
